# MU-Net

This is an implementation of our paper: A multiscale framework with unsupervised learning for remote sensing image registration.

The main file is demo.py, which inputs the image path and outputs the registration result.

Some *. py files in tools are encrypted as *. pyd files, which can be normally invoked in Python 3.8 and Win 64 environments.

Any question pls contact: ttf@my.swjtu.edu.cn
